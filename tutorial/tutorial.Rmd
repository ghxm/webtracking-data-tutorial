# Introduction

In this code along, we will work with the Web Tracking data from the GESIS panel.dbd (Campusfile: [ZA5670](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5670)). We will cover data loading, cleaning, and basic analysis using R. Make sure you have downloaded the data and placed it in the `data/` folder as per the setup instructions.
